Elements are useful, as well as id selectors. Classes are used to generalize, and you can use the window size to show or hide elements. Then you can transfer the data across. Flex is flexible to use, and lends a professional and stylish look to your website, even though the code does most of the hardwork for you.

Selectors are cool - it's called cascading for a reason, specifying hover for everything will lose in a fist fight against an id hover - transform is your friend in animation, but you can do cooler stuff with JS - don't forget your positions or how your shapes were colored in the first place.


Readonly is useful for just that in HTML. "&infin" with a semicolon at the end is the escape sequence for infinity. A menu is specifically interactive! Variables start with "var" surrounded by brackets, but not sure how to use them yet. Titles and headers are outlined in pink in the vim interface, so that makes it quick to find them. Remember that href links the text after.


Startup:
"Hey Jordan, remember that assassin game we would always play?"

"You mean the one from middle and high school where we "killed" eachother with plastic spoons?"

"Yeah, remember that time Jacob hid out in your car for 16 hours waiting for you?? It was always 
so tricky to know who was dead, who was alive, and who was targeting who, ect."

"That was crazy. It's always crazy... You know Joseph, we could make an app to keep track of that."

"What do you mean? Do you know how to do that??"

"Well, sort of. I'm going to be learning how to do it in my C.S. class."

"Which C.S. class, you are taking like 8 this semester."

"Nevermind - here's my idea:
An app that can keep track of the kills for people in this game. You could sign up for public matches,
and when you reach a certain number of people, the game is on. This app would allow you to keep a general
scoreboard of all the players, give a targetboard of who is targeting who, split the pot automatically,
and more!"

"Woah Jordan, that seems kind of crazy. But people can't know who is trying to kill them - that's part of
the fun.

"Okok here is the solution, everyone has a codename right? And you are the only one who knows your own
codename. The target board would look like "Codename targets Realname". That way, everyone knows who 
they are targeting, but no one knows who is targeting them!"

"That's a pretty good idea... And you would update the app based on who killed who?"

"Sort of. The app would update itself. I have a simple formula for that, but we could totally do it,
I don't think it would be too hard."

"Sweet, when can we get started?"

"Well Joseph, it depends on the TA's. They have to approve my project before we start, but it's going 
to be sweet. We can hook all of our friends on it too. My little sister just started a game, and maybe
I can finish it time for her next one."
