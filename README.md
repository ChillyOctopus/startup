# startup

ok so this was pretty tricky to figure out. I have a ways to go, but you commit changes you want from where you made them (after saving them in your file system), then try to push them. If you aren't in github, you can pull from github the current version. If the versions are different on the same line, you work merge conflict, and can then push it back up merged. So I'm trying it again with this comment.
